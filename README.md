# Lnk — No fuss link shortening

- Did you just buy a new shiny & short domain? ✨
- Are you upset about the fact that one needs a PhD in Clusterology to setup existing link shorteners? 👀
- Do you like Rust? 🦀

Well, you have come to the right place. After refusing to install three different databases and setup countless PVCs let alone manage all of that madness just to run a gosh darn link shortener, I decided to write my own. How hard can it be?! Well, a couple hours later this repository was born. It is not perfect, it is likely not "safe", but it works for my use-case.

You get:

- Link shortening <sub>(duh)</sub>
- QR codes
- Custom slugs
- ~~A cookie 🍪~~

**Disclaimer:** This is very much a best-effort project. I built it out of frustration and for my own purposes. If it fits your need, great! If it does not, well ... there is not much I can or will do about it. If you want to implement something and send a PR, let me know — but do not expect me to implement it. I just do not have the time for it.

<sub>Chances are if it does not exist I was either too lazy or did not have the need for a given features.</sub>
